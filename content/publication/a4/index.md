abstract: Global warming may especially affect ectothermic insect species, making it necessary to forecast the capacity of these species to cope with climatic changes.In this study, we use circular statistics to examine the seasonal plasticity of 32 dung beetle species in 17 localities of a mountain Iberian assemblage. We assume that the high variability between localities in the seasonal patterns for the same species suggests that seasonal plasticity could minimise the demographic effects of climate change on local populations.
