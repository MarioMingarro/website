I am Mario Mingarro, a PhD student working at [MNCN-CSIC](https://www.mncn.csic.es) with a broad interest in macroecology, climate change and land use dynamics, trying to understand these concepts through the modeling and simulation. Basically I perform spatial analysis and statistical analysis using the R language.

My principal study focuses, together with [Jorge Lobo](https://biogeografia.org/), on how climate change and land use dynamics can affect protected areas effectiveness. Through different analyzes it is possible to know if these spaces are going to preserve the environmental conditions that they currently protect and thus model the possibility of connection with those places that will have, in the future, the environmental conditions that these protected spaces currently have. In this way, the possibility arises of being able to create ecological corridors in accordance with these threats, being a tool to present to managers and thus be able to make decisions taking into account potential threats. I also work with the analysis of environmental variables for diurnal lepidopterans in the Iberian Peninsula, together with [Rob Wilson](https://robwilsonmncn.wixsite.com/robwilsonmncn-1). To better understand how climate change affects them, we use microclimatic models comparing different mountain systems.
